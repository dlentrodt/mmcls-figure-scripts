This software is an archive of the code used to create the scientific figures of the article

- Dominik Lentrodt, Oliver Diekmann, Christoph H. Keitel, Stefan Rotter, JÃ¶rg Evers "Certifying multi-mode light-matter interaction in lossy resonators without a fit" (Preprint at https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2107.11775).

Requirements:
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, jupyter, possibly other standard python packages
- pynuss: A software package for nuclear resonance scattering. Currently unpublished and available from the author K. P. Heeg.
- pyrot: A software package implementing linear dispersion theory and Parratt's formalism for general one-dimensional cavities given by a refractive index profile, created for this paper. Available at TODO.
